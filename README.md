# meap

A fullstack meal prep and nutrition tracking app built to solve a real problem: staying healthy while juggling school, work, and the gym.

**Live App:** [meapprep.vercel.app](https://meapprep.vercel.app/)

## Why I Built This

As a master's student trying to build muscle, I struggled to track what I was eating and what ingredients I had in stock. Meal prepping was my solution for staying consistent, but managing recipes, nutrition, and inventory was chaotic. So I built meap to make it effortless.

This project represents 3 months of learning fullstack development while balancing school and work. It's my first production app built from scratch.

## Features

- 📊 **Nutrition Tracking** — Log meals with detailed macros and calorie breakdowns
- 🥗 **Recipe Management** — Create, save, and organize custom recipes
- 🏪 **Inventory Tracking** — Keep track of ingredients in your fridge/pantry
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** — User accounts powered by Supabase Auth

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) — React framework with App Router
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — Type safety throughout
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Utility-first styling

**Backend:**
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) — PostgreSQL database, Auth, and API
- REST API design for future mobile app integration

**Deployment:**
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) — Continuous deployment

## What I Learned

This was my second fullstack project from scratch. Key learnings:

- **Database Design:** Architected a PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships between users, recipes, ingredients, and inventory
- **Authentication:** Implemented secure user auth with Supabase (signup, login, session management)
- **API Design:** Built RESTful endpoints thinking about future mobile app needs
- **State Management:** Managed complex app state across multiple features
- **Production Deployment:** Shipped a real app users can access
- **User Experience:** Designed intuitive workflows for tracking meals and managing inventory

## What's Next

Currently working on:
- 🎯 **Demo Mode** — Try the app without signing up (mock data)
- ✏️ **Full CRUD** — Edit and delete recipes/ingredients
- 📚 **Ingredient Database** — Pre-populate with nutritional data from external APIs
- 📱 **Mobile App** — iOS/Android version using the existing API
